They erased a 20-point fourth-quarter deficit against the New Orleans Pelicans in Game 3 of their first-round series in the 2015 playoffs.</p><p>In a December 2013 game against the Toronto Raptors, Curry scored 14 of the Warriors' 42 points in the fourth quarter to turn an 88-70 deficit into a 113-102 win.</p><p>When Curry first entered the NBA during the 2009-10 season, the <a href=# rel=noopener>average</a> number of three-point attempts per game was 18.1. That average was the same for three consecutive seasons from 2007-08 to 2009-10.</p><p>After a slight decrease in attempts per game to 18.0 in 2010-11, it increased in each of the next 11 seasons to a high-water mark of 35.2 in 2021-22.</p><p>Curry has averaged at least 9.8 three-point attempts per game in nine consecutive seasons, including the 2023-24 campaign. He also makes them at an astounding 42.6 percent rate for his career.</p><p>By comparison, Redick is <a href=# rel=noopener>regarded</a> as one of the best shooters in NBA history. He made 41.5 percent of his attempts behind the arc in his career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWiDcoWMpZybqp%2BjequtzJ6qZqukmr2pecKuqauxXZi1orrGnptmpp9iuaatw2agrGWjlrOmec2bmGamkae%2FosDIr5xmpZGdvK6x0magp2Wem7luwM6o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
