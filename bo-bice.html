His mother was a gospel singer as were his grandmother, great-grandmother, and aunts. Bice was nicknamed “Bogart” as a newborn by his grandmother, “Granny Madge”, because she thought he had “Humphrey Bogart eyes”. His family continued to call him Bogart, but when Bice was in kindergarten he shortened it to “Bo” because he did not think Bogart was cool. Bice’s parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother remarried years later. Bice grew up with his mother and step-father, Earle Downes, a Coca-Cola manager, step-sisters Jenny and Sharan Downes, and half-brother John Cohran.
