Kicking off with the euphoric ‘Never Let You Go’, Kygo teams up with Yorkshire singer-songwriter John Newman to deliver the perfect opening track. Full of energy, infectious hooks and John’s iconic vocals, ‘Never Let You Go’ is an anthem which will definitely leave its mark on you.
‘Sunrise’ features the vocals of Jason Walker, and is more of a chilled offering overall."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Full of energy, infectious hooks and John’s iconic vocals, ‘Never Let You Go’ is an anthem which will definitely leave its mark on you.</p><p><strong>‘Sunrise’</strong> features the vocals of Jason Walker, and is more of a chilled offering overall. The track has a groove-laden beat throughout and we love the use of violins at the beginning and end. It leads nicely into the Oliver Nelson produced <strong>‘Riding Shotgun’</strong> which features the album’s first female vocalist, Bonnie McKee. The track has a similar chilled vibe with a funky beat, whilst Bonnie’s vocals lace everything together.</p><p>Next up is <strong>‘Stranger Things’</strong> which features OneRepublic. Continuing with their recent experimentation, Ryan Tedder and co deliver a tropical offering which is instantly infectious. You cannot mistake Ryan’s distinctive vocals, and we love Kygo’s compelling production on the song.</p><p>Taking things down a notch, <strong>‘With You’</strong> featuring Wrabel is a noticeably gentler track. This allows for the heart-wrenching lyrics to take centre stage, showcasing that Kygo is capable of delivering more than just your standard high energy dance track.</p><p>The album continues with the title track <strong>‘Kids in Love’</strong>, featuring The Night Game. Whilst Kygo further explores romantic themes, the energy picks up during the song thanks to the euphoric instrumental.</p><p>The album’s penultimate track is <strong>‘Permanent’</strong> featuring JHart, whose vocals help to create something truly anthemic. Finally, the album comes to an end with <strong>‘I See You’</strong> featuring the distinctive vocals of Billy Raffoul. Production wise, the track is one of the most stripped back on the album, and focuses on Billy’s voice.&nbsp;We love how Kygo has laced the album together by opening and closing with the songs which feature the most unusual voices.</p><p>Bursting with guest collaborations and a variety of sounds, Kygo has produced a strong offering which is set to cement his status as one of the most exciting DJs around.</p><p>To coincide with the EP, Kygo has announced a ‘Kids in Love’ tour which will take place next year. Phase one of the tour includes dates in Europe, the UK and America. He will be supported by <a href=#>Gryffin</a>, Blackbear and <a href=#>Seeb</a>.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba3fIOhDwSK/?taken-by=kygomusic</p><h4>What are your thoughts on Kygo’s new album?
