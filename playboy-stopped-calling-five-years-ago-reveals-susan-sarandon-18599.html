&#34;They haven't asked me in about five years. They used to ask me on a regular basis,&#34; the actress revealed. &#34;I wanted to do it pregnant but they weren't game."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They used to ask me on a regular basis," the actress revealed. "I wanted to do it pregnant but they weren't game. That was before everyone else started doing it pregnant."</p><p>So would the Oscar winner ever consider it again? "I have sons now [so] I can't really [do it.]" Sarandon said. "When Lincoln Center did a thing and they showed a lot of my [old clips], my sons said, 'Didn't it ever occur to you that you would have children?' Then I asked my youngest, 'Are you okay?' And he said, 'Yeah, but scared, Mom.'"</p><p>Sarandon also revealed to Cohen that she was stoned at almost every single awards show she’s been to. When he originally asked her to name just one, she asked, “Only one?” and then went on to answer, “I would say almost all except the Oscars.”</p><p>Cohen clearly had a good time with his guest (and fellow guest Ralph Fiennes) tweeting after the show:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Great show!
