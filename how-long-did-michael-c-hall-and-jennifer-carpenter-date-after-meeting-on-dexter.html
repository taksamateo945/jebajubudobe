Naturally, Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter reprised their roles because Dexter wouldn’t be the same without the two of them. However, their relationship isn’t the same. While working on the original Dexter series, Hall and Carpenter met, married, and then divorced."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hall and Jennifer Carpenter met on the set of Dexter in 2006</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dexter-Jennifer-Carpenter-Michael-C-Hall-1024x692.jpg><p>On the show, Hall and Carpenter <a href=#>play brother and sister</a>. He’s the murderous&nbsp;titular character, and <a href=#>she’s the cop</a>. The two represent the classic good and evil dichotomy, although nothing is that black and white on Dexter. As brother and sister, Hall and Carpenter’s characters don’t have a lot of on-screen chemistry. But that didn’t stop something from blossoming between the actors themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Hall and Carpenter announced they were dating in 2007, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">InStyle</a>. This was just a year after they met on the set of Dexter.&nbsp;A year later, in 2008, the two tied the knot in an intimate ceremony. Hall and Carpenter eloped, so even their family was absent on their big day. Carpenter has said she feels a wedding is a special commitment between two people; it’s best celebrated with only those two people present.&nbsp;</p><p>The on-screen siblings continued to work on&nbsp;Dexter&nbsp;together after their wedding and even after Hall was diagnosed with a serious disease. In 2009, Hall announced he had Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a serious and sometimes fatal cancer. The treatment is intense, and Carpenter helped her husband through it. Once he was cancer-free, however, things fizzled.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-after-only-two-years-of-marriage-hall-and-carpenter-divorced>After only two years of marriage, Hall and Carpenter divorced&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jennifer Carpenter is reprising her role as Deb Morgan for Showtime’s revival of ‘Dexter’ alongside John Lithgow and limited series star Michael C.

By 2010, just a year later, his marriage to Carpenter was over. The <a href=#>two were married</a> for a total of two years and went through some difficult times during that period. They obviously still have a special bond, but their marriage just didn’t work out.&nbsp;</p><p>The two didn’t let their divorce affect their work. The original&nbsp;Dexter&nbsp;aired until 2013 — three years after the official end of Hall and Carpenter’s relationship. The two continued filming together, and things remained civil on set. Now, on the set of&nbsp;<a href=#>Dexter: New Blood</a>,&nbsp;Hall and Carpenter are working together again.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-michael-c-hall-and-jennifer-carpenter-still-get-along-great>Michael C.

Despite a short marriage, the two have been through a lot together. Apparently, they still joke constantly on the set. Their prior marital status hasn’t affected their relationship.</p><p>Hall and Carpenter are still good friends, although she does admit the ending of their marriage changed some things between them. In the end, they’re comfortable with each other. She told Today, “Just because the marriage ended doesn’t mean the love isn’t still there.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now, <a href=#>Michael C. Hall is married again</a>. His current wife is a book critic. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hidden Remote</a>, the two tied the knot in 2016. As for Carpenter, she married again in 2016 as well. Her current husband, Seth Avett, is in the music biz.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#><strong>‘Dexter’: Michael C.
