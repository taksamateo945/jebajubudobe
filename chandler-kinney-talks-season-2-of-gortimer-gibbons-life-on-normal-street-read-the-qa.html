Anaxagoras, a preschool teacher, was one of many aspiring filmmakers and screenwriters who submitted their ideas for original series through AmazonStudios.com, and whose concept moved forward as a pilot that debuted on Amazon Instant Video in February 2014.</p><p>CelebSecrets4U caught up with&nbsp;<strong>Chandler Kinney&nbsp;</strong>recently to talk all things season two of&nbsp;Gortimer Gibbon’s Life on Normal Street! In the interview, the 15-year-old actress told us about her character Catherine and how she’s grown since the first season. Chandler also dishes on her favorite part about working on set, how she relates to Catherine and a pretty cool on-set secret — make sure to read the Q&A below!</p><p>Season 2 of&nbsp;<strong>Gortimer Gibbon’s Life On Normal Street</strong>&nbsp;is expected to premiere the end of October.</p><p><strong>CS4U: Can you tell us a little bit about your character on</strong> <strong>Gortimer Gibbon’s Life on Normal Street</strong>?</p><p><strong>Chandler Kinney:</strong> “Catherine Dillman is an intelligent and clever girl. She is the best in her grade and perhaps, the smartest girl in school. Catherine is also very competitive. She is always looking for a way to improve and learn more.”</p><p><strong>CS4U: Gortimer Gibbon’s Life on Normal Street was renewed for a second season! What can we expect in this upcoming season?</strong></p><p><strong>Chandler Kinney:&nbsp;</strong>“In this upcoming season, there are many more fun adventures to come! Each episode contains a valuable lesson. You’ll also get a deeper look into each of the character’s lives and learn more about them. There will be some new interesting characters as well! A lot is going on in Season 2 and you won’t want to miss it!”</p><p><strong>CS4U: What is your favorite part about working with the cast of Gortimer Gibbon’s Life On Normal Street?</strong></p><p><strong>Chandler Kinney:&nbsp;</strong>“I love this cast because they are all quirky, unique, and fun! They are so creative and they all add something different to the show. I love being with them on and off set.”</p><p><strong>CS4U: In what ways if any, do you feel you relate to your character Catherine in Gortimer Gibbon’s Life On Normal Street?</strong></p><p><strong>Chandler Kinney:&nbsp;</strong>“I definitely can relate to my character Catherine! We are very passionate about our education. We also both share a detail oriented perspective as well as a desire to improve. Catherine and I are perfectionists and overachievers. We’re pretty similar!”</p><p><strong>CS4U: Where would you like to see Catherine go in the upcoming season?</strong></p><p><strong>Chandler Kinney:&nbsp;</strong>“I’d like to see Catherine explore some of her deeper emotions. She’s always very controlled and poised. I think it would be interesting to see her “lose her cool” for once.”</p><p><strong>CS4U: Since our website is called CelebSecrets4U can you share with our readers an on set secret? Something that the fans wouldn’t know about.</strong></p><p><strong>Chandler Kinney:&nbsp;</strong>“Something many people don’t know about our set is that we all like to prank the crew and other cast members! We have this “clip game” where we all have clothespins and we try to pin them on the back of someone’s clothes without them noticing. It’s a fun, light-hearted game that we love to play!”</p><h2 class="g1-beta g1-beta-2nd">What's Your Reaction?</h2><span class=ppma-layout-prefix></span> <span class="ppma-category-group ppma-category-group-"><ul class=pp-multiple-authors-boxes-ul><li class="pp-multiple-authors-boxes-li author_index_0 author_celebsecrets4u has-avatar" readability=0.92266666666667><img data-del=avatar alt="Juliet Schroder" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/07/IMG_0935-96x96.jpg height=80 width=80 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="pp-author-boxes-description multiple-authors-description">Juliet is the founder and executive producer/host of Celeb Secrets and Celeb Secrets Country.
