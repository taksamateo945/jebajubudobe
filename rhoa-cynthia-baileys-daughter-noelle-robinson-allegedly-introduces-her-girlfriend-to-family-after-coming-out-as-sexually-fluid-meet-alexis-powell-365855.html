Not only did Bailey play it cool when she was hit with the shocking confession but she has made sure that her daughter knows she has her full support.</p><p>The supermodel <a href=#>opened up about the episode</a> and her daughter’s sexuality on People TV.</p><p>‘I’ve always tried to be the kind of parent to Noelle to make her feel like she can tell me anything. I didn’t talk about sex [with] my mom, let alone my sexuality or anything like that. So I really wanted to make sure that she felt comfortable talking to me about it. And she did, as you saw.’</p><p>She went on to say how important it was that Noelle feels accepted.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8EwGaHpZbO/</a></p><p>‘You know, in the times we live in, people have their camera phones and I would hate for someone to video her with one of her little friends and then put it out there. Because what happens when you’re on a reality show is if it’s out there before you put it out there, it’s like a secret that we’ve had, that we were trying to hide something.’</p><p>Bravo has a huge LGBT+ fan base who praised Noelle’s bravery and Cynthia’s reaction.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Robinson also posted about the viral moment by thanking viewers and her supporters for their inspiring messages.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinbyiecKypa2gmZZ6o63IpZyyq12Zrrazx62cq2WepLKtuMRmqaiamaPAsLqMmqOlnZeasa3FjKKlraqfmcKksdJmn56qXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiwbB5xZqkoqSpYq6nwMSrZJynnZ67qHnOrqtmmaNiwKbE1JqjpbFdm7m2tcNmpJ6dpGKurbHXoqpmqJ%2Bssq24jGxtbnBlanw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
