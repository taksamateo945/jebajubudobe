It is blessed with both human and natural resources. Above all, it is a country with some of the fastest-growing billionaires in the world. The youngest and richest youths in Nigeria have not only achieved financial success but have also made significant contributions to the economic growth of the country cutting across businesses, entertainment and the technological sector.</p><p>Despite raging challenges such as economic instability and political turmoil, these young billionaires have managed to create thriving businesses and solidify their positions as leaders in Africa’s business community. While the likes of Obiozor of Kobo360 and the Dozie brothers make our list of the top 20 young billionaires in Nigeria, here are details of the top ten of Nigeria’s youngest and richest billionaires.</p><h2><strong>Igho Sanomi Is the Richest Youth in Nigeria</strong></h2><p><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $ 1 billion (about ₦460,340,000,000)<br><strong>Age:</strong> 53 Years Old<br><strong>Sources of Income:</strong> Oil, power, logistics, telecommunications, Marine, aviation, real estate<br><strong>Company:</strong> Taleveras&nbsp;Group</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Igho-Sanomi.jpg alt width=696 height=471 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Igho Charles Sanomi is a geologist and public speaker with strong business interest in oil, power, logistics, telecommunications, aviation, real estate, and the maritime industry. Son of a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, Sanomi was born and raised in Agbor, Delta State, on 17 May 1975 and he is the fifth child of his parent.</p><p>He is the founder of Taleveras, a $2 billion-worth international commodities trading company based in Nigeria (Abuja) and Dubai with additional offices spread across West Africa, Europe and Asia. He became fascinated with the oil industry while in his final year at the University of Jos, Plateau state.</p><p>He handled a couple of structured deals for local oil companies after which he went into a long-term venture with Masefield. After having practical knowledge about oil business, Sanomi was ready to establish his own company and handle oil-related contracts himself. With the little saving he had, alongside his savings from the profit share he had earned from joint venture transactions, Sanomi put together a small team and opened his first business called Sarian Oil.</p><p>With Sarian oil, Sanomi built his business on the back of third-party contracts a few years later, his company became the preferred supplier of fuel oil feedstock to major USA refiners. At the age of 28, he merged various segments of his trading business and renamed the company Taleveras. In its prime, Sanomi’s oil trading company transported over 170 million barrels of crude and oil products annually. Today, it is considered one of the largest independent energy traders in Africa.</p><p>Sanomi has traditionally stayed away from the media spotlight but amid his silence, he has received numerous awards both locally in internationally. He was even cited by Forbes as one of the “Ten Young African Millionaires To Watch in 2013.

Ladi is the son of a corporate executive and an MBA lecturer and under the tutelage of his father, he was able to understand business trends and how different products come to the market.</p><p>Delana’s first business was as a career adviser to students. He also got recruiters to advertise their companies to students, and set up m-commerce retail platforms where students could make purchases with their mobile phones. This, however, folded up roughly six months after, leading to loss of thousands of dollars.</p><p>In his early 20s, Delana was already a satisfied businessman. He established Solidarnosc Asia, a Chinese alcoholic beverage company that made Solid XS, a premium brand of vodka brand that was distributed in over 30 cities, pulling in $20 million in annual revenue. He later sold the company to a rival liquor business for over $15 million.</p><p>Having tried two businesses that later failed, Delana relocated to Nigeria in 2012 with the hope of digging deep into the country’s potentials. With the knowledge he gained about the country’s growing economy, he pulled together a consortium of high-net-worth families and some financial institutions in the private equity space to invest in Nigeria.</p><p>To achieve his aim, he partnered with Bakrie Group which is one of the largest conglomerates in Indonesia. The joint venture invested in mining, agriculture, and oil and gas industries in Nigeria.

The political science degree holder from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, made his first N1 million from furnishing a house for a client who dashed him N500,000 for a job well done. The money summed up to over a million naira after adding his profit of N600,000.</p><p>His financial stance continued to grow as he received more house contracts. His contract with PPMG and other brands led to his establishment of Ibiza Club in 2006. Located in Abuja, Nigeria’s federal capital, Ibiza Club recorded great sales; by 2009, profits generated from the nightclub laid the foundation of the Cubana hospitality services which is now located in Owerri, Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and other states in Nigeria.</p><p>Obi Cubana’s interest in the hospitality industry has undoubtedly enriched his pocket.

This experience and financial success ignited and further deepened his interest in real estate</p><p>Sijibomi founded his company in 2013 while partnering with Yazeed Alrahji, a real estate magnate in Saudi Arabia. The name Sujimoto was borrowed from Sijibomi’s mentor, Sujimoto Koga, a Japanese professor who helped boost his confidence and influenced his business initiatives.</p><p>Lincoln Avenue, a set of 16 townhouses of 4-bedroom apartments in Accra, Ghana, was Sujimoto’s first major real estate project.
