We’d be very grateful for your support as we take time apart to reevaluate what we want from life and from one another. Life’s a journey and love’s a process. With that universal truth in mind, we’ve mutually decided to put off the formalization of our marriage certificate and to put our faith in the process. Thank you for respecting our privacy.’</p><p>Furthermore, one source also tells HollywoodLife that the actress ‘asked for a break to think about this a little more.’</p><p>As you probably know, this shocking piece of information comes after it was confirmed that they had tied the knot in a small and intimate Malibu ceremony on January 20.</p><p>Amongst the few guests, her sons with ex Tommy Lee, Brandon, and Dylan, were in attendance, as well as Jon’s daughters and his former wife!</p><p>Their wedding seemed really sudden but this is not the first time they took their relationship a step further since they also dated in the 1980s.</p><p>After they broke up, however they remained friends and even live close by in the Malibu area.</p><p>It’s sad to hear that after only 12 days, they have decided to end things.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>After all, following the wedding, Jon sweetly gushed over Pamela, saying that ‘There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but — for 35 years — I’ve only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild — in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and I treat her the way she deserves to be treated.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeglrqmuMBmmKeclafAsLqMmqWdZZqku268xK2cq6tdqLKxrdGaq55ln6O5unmQa2SdmamoeqKy056pZqyYmrazedKuqamqmaiybsPEnZuippdigHeBlW5waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
