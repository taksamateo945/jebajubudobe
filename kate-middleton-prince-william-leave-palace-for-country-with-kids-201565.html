Looking as gorgeous as ever just a few days after giving birth, the mother of two was casually chic with her hair pulled back, a floral scarf around her neck, and classic pearl <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> dangling from her lobes.</p><p>The trip comes in the midst of Prince William’s paternity leave, which lasts until June 1. Middleton will spend the subsequent months off as well, bonding with her new daughter and caring for the two children with the help of a new night maternity nurse.&nbsp;</p><p>The family of four spent a couple of days at the palace after bringing Princess Charlotte home from the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital in London.

Nothing feels better than having your mom around during a time like this.”</p><p>For more on Princess Charlotte and all things royal baby, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKarJViuqqww6WcraeeYr2ztc2cnGavmaG5qq3MZqOemaaaerGty5qanmWWpL9ur86upa2qqWLEqsDHZqKinKNif3F9lG9s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
