She lived a remarkable life up to the last moment. A true pioneer, who bared her heart and soul so we could witness the spirit of the characters she so brilliantly portrayed, which continue to move and inspire generations.&nbsp; A Black queen who showed us how beautiful black is. The love between us was and is tremendous.&nbsp; As long as I have had consciousness, I’ve known Godmother.’</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/wIGrKRM7PO</a></p><p>— Lenny Kravitz (@LennyKravitz) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 29, 2021</a></p><p>The musician went on to say: ‘She and my mother were kindred spirits. Sisters. And after my mother passed, Godmother’s role in my life was amplified.&nbsp; I constantly felt her spirit over me. She always gave me unconditional support. She came to my shows, came over for holidays, met me for dinners, stayed with me in Paris when I first moved there, and never let me too far out of her sight. Our phone calls went on sometimes for hours. We spoke just a few nights ago and talked about everything. She had just sent me her book that has been sitting on my nightstand where it will remain. She did it all, wrote the book, and then God called her. I can hear Godmother saying&nbsp; “ok, now y’all can read about it, I’m going home”. Rest peacefully, Godmother. You did it all exquisitely&nbsp;#CicelyTyson.’</p><p>Meanwhile, Tyler Perry shared a beautifully prepared video of his and Tyson’s friendship that started 16 years ago. In the video, viewers got to witness Perry and Tyson’s playful relationship and the unveiling of Cicely’s sound stage at Tyler Perry’s movie studio.</p><p>He also shared that the news of her passing brought him to his knees because he felt the urge to watch one of her movies right before he was notified that she was no longer with us.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It’s clear that Cicely broke boundaries and touched people in ways that will stay with them forever. May she rest in peace.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecmruvxYykqZqumanHbq3NnWStsZyav268xKupsmWjna6zsYyepKismaS7oriMramimqWpsrR506hknKGTmrm6edOyqqimXWmEdH%2BUbmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
