Money heist received its spinoff <a href=#>Berlin</a>, but we are yet to be informed when the third season of Who Killed Sara will return on our screens. As we wait for the screen favorites, Netflix released another fan’s favorite Spanish series, The Longest Night. Created by Dose Morais, the series offers all the twists and suspense that fans who enjoy <a href=#>prison</a> escape series like <a href=#>Prison Break</a> would appreciate. Here is everything you need to know about the <a href=#>Netflix thriller series</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Longest Night Season 2 Release Date: When will it be out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-longest-night-release-date.jpg><p>So far, there is no announcement regarding the future of the thriller series. The <a href=#>crime series</a> was released on 8th July this year and up until now, the show creators and Netflix is yet to give an update. The show has garnered a rating of 5.7/10 on IMDB and since series with the same ratings have gotten a renewal on IMDB, chances are that we may get a second season of the show.</p><p>The first season had six episodes and the second season might have the same number of episodes or more. If Netflix gives the green light for the second installment, then 2023 might be a good year for the show’s fans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Longest Night Season 2 Plot: What will happen?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-longest-night-plot.jpg><p>Season one ending was intense as it showed Hugo contacting Rosa and Andres in an attempt to save Baraka Laura missed the bullet by a whisker but in return triggered her heart problems and Lennon confronted Hugo on the Rooftop. It did not take Hugo and Lennon long to realize that Simon has been getting information from an outsider that facilitated his manipulation of them.</p><p>The last season also revealed the mysterious man who has been making everything twisted. In case of a renewal, the second season will explore the mystery man further and whether Laura will survive the tough spot. Despite Rosa and Andre having an anecdote4 for her heart problem, the show might take a different twist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Longest Night Season 2 Cast: Who will be in?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-longest-night-cast.jpg><p>The series feature Alberto Amman (<a href=#>Narcos: Mexico</a>) as Hugo Roca, Luis Vallejo as Simon Lago, Jose Luis Garcia (<a href=#>El Cid</a>) as Lennon, Maria Caballero (<a href=#>The Girl in The Mirror</a>) as Laura, Xabier Deive as Bastos AND Barbara Geoneag as Elisa Montero. Orther casts include Cecilia Freire as Manuela, Adolfo Fernandez as Dr Espada Laia Manzanares, Roberto Alamo and Daniel Albaladejo. If the series gets renewed for the second season, then we should expect all of the cast to reprise their roles apart from Sable Aran as Macarena Montes is likely to have died. We should also expect to see new faces as the story’s plot thickens.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Longest Night Season 2 Trailer: When will it be out?</h2><p>A series trailer will not be available until the series gets renewed and the release date of the second season nears. If the series gets a renewal for the second season, then the trailer might be released in 2023. In the meantime, you can check out the first season trailer on Netflix. Another similar series on Netflix is Money Heist and Who Killed Sara.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK5706GcZqSfo7Smv9NmpaKfmKl6tLHArKanZaKauaat0p5knZmkmnqkrdKtZKmkn6l6sb7EnaCcrJmku27A0ZqgpZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
