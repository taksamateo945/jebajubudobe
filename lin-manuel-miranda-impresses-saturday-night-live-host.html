Despite claiming that he wasn’t going to perform any songs from his smash hit musical, Hamilton, he kind of did. During his opening monologue, one of the most iconic and classic parts of the SNL show, he sang a parody of ‘My Shot’ from the show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During his opening monologue, one of the most iconic and classic parts of the SNL show, he sang a parody of ‘My Shot’ from the show. Not only did he make it relevant to the show, but he also included several political references, including a slight jab towards presidential candidate, Donald Trump and also reminding the public to vote in the election in November.</p><p>You can watch his inventive monologue below!</p><p></p><p>Lin-Manuel Miranda garnered a monstrous amount of praise, with #SNLinManuel trending for hours after the show finished and many people impressed with how he managed to intertwine current affairs within his monologue. Even Grey’s Anatomy and How To Get Away With Murder creator, Shonda Rhimes, was excited for this television event.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pretty sure a Puerto Rican <a href=#>@Lin_Manuel</a> just delivered the most relevant opening monologue in <a href=#>@nbcsnl</a> history! & US politics. <a href=#>#SNLinManuel</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UNCmlZju3v</a></p><p>— Gilluis Pérez (@GilluisPerez_) <a href=#>October 9, 2016</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Lin_Manuel</a> blew the top off the <a href=#>@nbcsnl</a> opener. Instant classic on a classic NYC stage. <a href=#>#SNLinManuel</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SGDkBNZvSC</a></p><p>— Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) <a href=#>October 9, 2016</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Already so happy. <a href=#>#SNLinManuel</a></p><p>— shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) <a href=#>October 9, 2016</a></p><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be Saturday Night Live without their signature short skits, would it? Along with the regular stars of the show and some special cameo appearances from stars&nbsp;such as Leslie Jones, Lin-Manuel participated in a parody of Stranger Things, the Netflix series which took over the world this past summer.</p><p>The opening claimed that this special ‘behind the scenes’ of season two will answer burning questions such as ‘where is the Upside Down?’ ‘is Barb coming back?’ and ‘where is that black kid’s family?’ Miranda takes on the part of Dustin and it is possibly the best thing we have seen this year. If they ever need an actor to play an older version or Gaten Matarazzo’s character in Stranger Things then Lin-Manuel should definitely be the first person they call.</p><p>Check out the skit below!</p><p></p><p>What are your thoughts on Lin-Manuel Miranda’s episode of Saturday Night Live?
