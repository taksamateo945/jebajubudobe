Even more amazing, not the worst review it got."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amy:</strong> "Boyhood proves that there are still great roles for women over 40 as long as you get hired when you're under 40."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tina:</strong> "Joaquin Phoenix is nominated for Inherent Vice but obviously he isn't here tonight because he has said publicly that awards shows are total and utter bulls–t… Oh hey, Joaquin! There he is!"</p><p><strong>Tina: </strong>"Steve Carell's Foxcatcher look took two hours to put on, including his hairstyling and makeup. Just for comparison it took me three hours today to prepare for my role as human woman."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amy:</strong> "Wes Anderson is here tonight for the movie Grand Budapest Hotel. Per usual, Wes arrived on a bike made of antique tuba parts."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tina: </strong>"George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin this year. Amal is a human rights lawyer, who worked on the Enron case, was an advisor to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected for a three person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Tina: </strong>"Selma, in the 1960s thousands of black people from all over America came together with one common goal to form Sly and the Family Stone, but the movie Selma is about the American Civil Rights Movement that totally worked and now everything's fine."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Amy: </strong>"In Into the Woods, Cinderella runs from her prince, Rapunzel is thrown from a tower for her prince, and Sleeping Beauty just thought she was getting coffee with Bill Cosby."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tell Us:</strong> Did you enjoy Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's opening monologue?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOraCnmV2bsrp5wKawZqifmrWtsdFmmZ6rpGK0sLjDnqVmn5ykr6a%2FjKOmpJ2jYn9xfZRqaGo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
