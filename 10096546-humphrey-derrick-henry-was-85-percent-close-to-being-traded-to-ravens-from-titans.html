Speaking on his Punch Line podcast (beginning at the 5:30 mark), Humphrey said he &#34;got a text&#34; from a source before the deadline who told him a Henry trade to Baltimore was &#34;85 percent&#34; likely to happen:
The trade did not come to fruition, as Henry stayed in Tennessee and the Ravens stood pat at the deadline."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lone exception was when he rushed for 937 yards and 10 scores in just eight games in 2021.</p><p>King Henry led the NFL in rushing in 2019 (1,540 yards) and 2020 (2,027 yards), and he rushed for 1,538 yards last season as well.</p><p>He has also rushed for a remarkable 72 touchdowns in 79 games dating back to the 2018 season.</p><p>In the first game of the 2023 campaign, the Ravens lost starting running J.K. Dobbins for the season with a torn Achilles, which has largely forced them to go with the combination of Gus Edwards and Justice Hill in the backfield.</p><p>Baltimore has not missed a beat, as its 7-2 record is tied with the Kansas City Chiefs for the best mark in the AFC.</p><p>With quarterback Lamar Jackson at the controls, the Ravens rushed for 298 yards as a team in a 37-3 drubbing of the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.</p><p>Jackson, Edwards and Hill all contributed to the ground game, but the breakout star was undrafted rookie Keaton Mitchell, who rushed for 138 yards and a touchdown on nine carries.</p><p>Given Mitchell's showing and how successful Baltimore's ground game has been, Humphrey suggested Wednesday that the Ravens may not have needed a star running back like Henry after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWuCdYKMoaymqJinsrp5w56pq6GToHqpsc2rsGavkah6eYGMqZyrm5WjwW6vy6iqnmWkpHqjscinnmasopaxprCMraZmqpGrsq%2B%2FjJ%2BpqKVdqba1rc2s</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
