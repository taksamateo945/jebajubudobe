You are everything I could have dreamed of and so much more.</p><p>“Proud doesn’t cover it, my heart swells with feelings I can’t put in to words. You are deeply extraordinary in every way.</p><p>“Happy birthday my darling girl. I hope you know how special you are, and how much light you have brought to all who are lucky enough to know you. Especially me.</p><p>“I say it all the time and I will never stop… in the words of auntie Drew, I was born the day you were born. I love you.
