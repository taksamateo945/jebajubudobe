"It has been my dream all along to bring the creative energy of our bar and restaurant concepts to my hometown and I couldn’t be more thrilled to see the vision we’ve been working on finally come to life in the Seaport."&nbsp;</p><p>Borrachito's menu&nbsp;features elevated tacos including the Crackling Pork Belly, featuring a truffled Valentina salsa, and the Nashville Hot Cauliflower with a cilantro ranch and roasted shishito peppers.&nbsp;</p><p>Every taco starts with fresh tortillas made in-house every day, The Garret Group said. The taqueria will also be open daily from 11 a.m. until late at night.</p><p>Borrachito's design is inspired by "1950 style roadside eateries and the fusion of old school Route 66 Americana meets a trip south of the border," The Garret Group said.&nbsp;Guests are transported back in time when see a diner-style room upon entry, complete with a pick-up window.&nbsp;</p><p>That aesthetic continues to the back space of the restaurant, known as The Bar Room, which features&nbsp;950s era industrial light fixtures, wood paneling, tile work and artwork featuring sourced collected of Vintage Mexican movie posters.&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s not just a dining or bar concept, we’ve created a place where people in Boston can celebrate their best moments,"&nbsp;said&nbsp; Co-Founder & Creative Director at The Garret Group&nbsp;Adam Fulton.</p><p>"Every design element has a purpose, every decision we’ve made has had this specific market in mind," he continued. "We’re really looking forward to being a part of such a great city."&nbsp;</p><p>The bar,&nbsp;which will be open from 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily, features elevated cocktails like The Horchata Espresso Martini and The Dunes of Monico.
