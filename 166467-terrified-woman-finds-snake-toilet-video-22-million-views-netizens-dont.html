Snakes even enter through doors and open windows and pipes filled with water. One way to prevent this is to keep the toilet lid closed and seal the tubes and lids to keep them from entering.</p><h2>Nick Evans tells <strong>Briefly News </strong>that it might not be poisonous</h2><p class=align-left>Snake-catcher <a href=#>Nick Evans</a> told <strong>Briefly News </strong>that the snake in the video may be a rat snake and is not a venomous snake.</p>"Snakes can end up in the strangest places. I have seen a photo or video or two of snakes in toilets. I do catch a lot of snakes in the bathrooms, where they often come in through an open window. Should someone encounter a snake in their toilet, in the bowel or room, move back slowly, close the door and phone a snake-catcher," he said.<p class=align-left>Watch the video here:</p><h2>Netizens have questions about the snake in the toilet</h2><p class=align-left>Netizens had questions about the video and lightly joked about the woman while sharing their snake phobias.</p><p class=align-left>Despina wanted to know:</p>“Do yall not look in the toilet before you sit down?
