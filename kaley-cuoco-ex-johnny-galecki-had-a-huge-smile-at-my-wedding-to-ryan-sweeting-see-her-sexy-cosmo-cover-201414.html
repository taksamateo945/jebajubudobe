The blonde CBS star admits to Cosmo that the breakup wasn’t without some hiccups."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The blonde CBS star admits to Cosmo that the breakup wasn’t without some hiccups. “It took a minute, a bit of awkwardness,” Cuoco says. “By the grace of God, we became best buddies and moved on in such an elegant way. [He’s] one of my closest friends.”</p><p>When Cuoco wed Sweeting, 26, this past New Year’s Eve after just six months of dating, Galecki — now dating actress <strong>Kelli Garner</strong> — was among the honored guests. “He was in the front row at my wedding, with a huge smile on his face,” Cuoco adds.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt=kaley width=467 height=647 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>About that <a href=#>quickie engagement</a> and lavish wedding? “I admit it happened fast, but that’s who I am. When we met, I knew he was the one,” Cuoco reasons. “[At my wedding], I felt like a rock star and a badass. What was amazing in that room, it was so full of love. It was like nothing I’d ever been to before, and it was exactly what we wanted it to be. It was the eighth wonder of the world, the greatest wedding of all time.”</p><p>Her epic romance with Sweeting was preceded — briefly — by <a href=#>another high-profile courtship</a>, this one with Man of Steel star <a href=#><strong>Henry Cavill.</strong></a></p><p>“I had no one following me until I met Superman,” she says of the summer 2013 media circus. “I’ve been in this business for 20 years, and my whole life, I could go anywhere, do anything. There had not been one paparazzi photo of me until like several months ago. The recognition was crazy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKapJWueqTBzpymZp2oYrewtM2nsGafkaGypLfIZp%2BanF2WeqnBxp5krKWZobJurdNmpLJlp5qxpbXNoGStp12nxqK6jKyunp2knruoedKenGaglad6tLHXsmScp6OivG6vzq%2Bcq2ViZX51fZM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
