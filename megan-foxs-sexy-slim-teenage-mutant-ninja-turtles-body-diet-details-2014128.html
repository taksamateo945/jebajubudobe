The stunning actress, 28, looks amazing in the reptilian romp, stealing the spotlight from Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Donatello.&nbsp;</p><p>To find out how Fox got into such good shape for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — and shortly after the birth of second son <strong>Bodhi</strong> — <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a></strong> exclusively caught up with the star's trainer, <strong>Harley Pasternak</strong>, who also makes an appearance in TMNT.&nbsp;</p><p>Far from starving herself, Fox relies on a well-balanced diet to give her energy. "She eats carbs," says the trainer, 40, who has also worked with <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Katy Perry</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Lady Gaga</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Jennifer Hudson</a></strong>. "She just eats the right carbs. She has a low-sugar diet. It's so sustainable, it's so moderate, she's not doing any zero this/zero that."&nbsp;</p><p>"She eats three meals and two snacks a day," Pasternak continued. "She’ll have protein, fiber, and healthy fat every meal. She is living a low-sugar lifestyle, definitely… She has definitely buckled down and she is amazing."</p><p>Whereas some stars rely on meal-delivery services, Fox prepares her food at home. "Here’s a busy mom of two kids, well really three kids, and she’s doing it," he says. "She’s sticking to it, and she realized she doesn’t have to make elaborate meals in the kitchen. In the morning she’ll do a smoothie or an egg white omelet with some avocado as healthy fats. And she’ll have hummus and cut veggies as a snack and a salad with grilled chicken for lunch."</p><p>As for Fox's exercise routine, the wife to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Brian Austin Green</a></strong> and mother to son <strong>Noah</strong>, 22 months, and son Bodhi, 7 months, has been focusing on her strength. "She’s someone who naturally doesn’t love working out traditionally," the fitness expert adds. "She has really adopted this great consistency and this great approach to working out; it started during her first pregnancy and has carried on through now."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To tone her muscles, Fox trains with Pasternak. "She’s resistance training with me at least three days a week," Pasternak tells Us. "They’re short, these workouts. [We're] really focusing on the muscles behind her body and to draw her <a href=# data-link=1>posture</a> back. She was basically just pregnant for the better part of two years in between carrying babies. So we got strength in her upper back with back rows, dumbbell rows, and the lower back with the Superman [stretch] for lower back."</p><p>Fox adds in cardio with a machine called a Helix Lateral Trainer. "Look at her now," he says. "She looks as good as she’s ever looked if not better."</p><p>Fox's hard work clearly paid off as she looks incredible in TMNT — and on the red carpets of the press tour —&nbsp;which is seeing big success of its own. The action flick opened on Friday, Aug. 8, and won the weekend box office. The movie took the No. 1 spot with a weekend gross of $65.57 million, bringing in an additional $28.7 million abroad for a total weekend debut of $94.27 million.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKSen5Gjeqe716xkrJ2ornq0uMimZK2dlaOuqLGMpqytmZ6peq%2B1zaOYZqylp8GtsdJmmaicqWKxqrHTZpuerJGeubR5kWlobWlibQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
