"Five quarters of hard-nosed football, it was worth every single discomfort and pain that I woke up to and I couldn't be happier for the guys, man."</p><p>One reason for the added discomfort is both teams played essentially an entire extra quarter in overtime. The game ended with three seconds remaining in the first overtime period when Patrick Mahomes found Mecole Hardman in the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.</p><p>By game time, Super Bowl 58 took 74 minutes, 57 seconds to complete. It was the <a href=# rel=noopener>seventh-longest</a> game in NFL history. It was a few seconds away from being the first <a href=# rel=noopener>double-overtime game</a> since the 2012 AFC Divisional Round matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Denver Broncos.</p><p>The 49ers and Chiefs combined for 150 plays. Both teams had players sustain injuries, including Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti playing through a <a href=# rel=noopener>torn UCL</a> suffered in the second quarter. <b></b></p><p>In the end, it was the Chiefs who were able to weather the storm to prevail and win the Super Bowl for the third time in the past five seasons. They are the first team to win back-to-back titles since the New England Patriots in 2003 and 2004.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG6AdYOMnJ%2BinZaoerW%2BwK%2BgrGWbmrmksYyfnKWsXaG2rLGMomSwmaNitq95wGarq5mZo3q4vsScomacka56orLTnqlmq6WlsrN5waiupWVlbXq4tc0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
