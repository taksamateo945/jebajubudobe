How much that will help to facilitate a trade remains to be seen.</p><p>Last September, Yahoo Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Jake Fischer</a> reported "there just doesn't seem to be a robust market for LaVine's services," and that remained the case months into the season.</p>NBA on ESPN <span class=acct>@ESPNNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"There is not a market for Zach LaVine right now."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wojespn&lt;/a> with the latest on LaVine and the Bulls 👀 &lt;a href="https://t.co/r4stqcKkor">pic.twitter.com/r4stqcKkor&lt;/a></p><p>Then the 29-year-old underwent season-ending foot surgery in February, further eroding his trade value.</p><p>In his seven years with the Bulls, LaVine has averaged 24.2 points on 47.1 percent shooting, including 38.3 percent on three-pointers. He'd potentially be a dynamic secondary scorer on a playoff contender.</p><p>The trouble is, he's owed <a href=# rel=noopener>$138 million</a> over the next three seasons, assuming he picks up his 2026-27 option, and that's a lot of money when he's arguably not a max player in terms of what he brings to the court.</p><p>In addition, LaVine's foot surgery played into the existing concerns over his durability. He has exceeded 70-plus games played just once since 2015-16.</p>Ricky O'Donnell <span class=acct>@SBN_Ricky</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>A lot of the Zach LaVine narratives that have felt pretty unfair throughout his career are unfortunately proving true this year</p><p>The Bulls can probably find a taker for the 6'5" guard if they're resigned to this being a salary dump rather than something that can meaningfully improve the roster in the short term.</p><p>Based on Johnson's newest report, other teams are well aware of how desperate the front office is to move on, though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqBeIWMs5icoF2hrre1zZ5kraqRmbJuvtSmpqurXZfCrbjSZp2lp5GpsqV5wKxkppmernqiv4xqbGanlpuys7%2BMraZmb2aav7R5yqKloKtdoryzsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
