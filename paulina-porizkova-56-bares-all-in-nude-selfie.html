I mean, besides things like reading a good book or watching Italian TV.”</p><p>Porizkova was also inspired to take the sexy snap because of the “pretty happening” bathroom in her room at Hotel Eden, where she’s staying in Rome.</p><p>The timeless beauty noted in her hashtags that between 51-year-old Jennifer Lopez and 99-year-old Betty White, #sexyhasnoexpirationdate.</p><p>She concluded, “And for all of you who have a rough time with nudity, this thread will not be a safe place for you. Godspeed.”</p><p>Porizkova <a href=#>previously told Page Six</a> that she regularly faces critics — who are mostly women — who shame her for flaunting her figure on social media.</p><p>“I think we’ve made enormous strides in accepting all different sorts of beauty; I think size and color and all of these things that used to be so uniform now have broadened to a pretty spectacular [degree],” Porizkova told us in May. “But age, ageism, that’s kind of like the last frontier.”</p><p>Most recently, she showed off her abs in a gold bikini in June and posed in <a href=#>a completely see-through bodysuit</a> for the cover of Vogue Czechoslovakia in April.</p><p>The former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model does not only have a great body because of genetics, but also because of a lot of hard work in the gym.</p><p>Porizkova <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on Instagram</a> in June that she works out three to five times a week and, admitted, “I frickin hate it.”</p><p>“I don’t like to sweat and huff and puff and hurt,” she said. “If sitting on a couch, eating cake, drinking wine and reading did the same for me as exercise, there would be no contest. BUT. I have come to find out that ‘working out’ is that perfect little pill everyone is looking for.</p><p>The model concluded, “It makes you feel good, look good, good for your brain and body – a small miracle that has to be paid of by a little discomfort.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoJbCrbXNmmSpp6Kex6y71Zpkbm5dl66zsdJmmKWkXZ67brrUnZxmq5Whs6qxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
