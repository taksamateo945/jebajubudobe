But that will never be enough for me. I can’t imagine my life without you and I never imagined this day would come. You were an inspiration to everyone who knew you and I will aspire to be everything you were. You truly lived life to the fullest and were such a fighter. The memories we made will forever be instilled in me and I’ll never forget the good times we had. You were not only my mom, but my best friend. Thank you for everything you’ve thought me and for the wisdom you’ve given me. I will never ever stop loving you. Life won’t be easy without you but I know you will be with me every step of the way. Rest in peace mommy, I love you with all my heart.”</p><p>The high school student’s emotional post was preceded by an update about her mom’s condition last week. “Never miss the opportunity to tell your mom you love her,” she pleaded with her Instagram followers. “No matter how much you do, it will never be enough. Stay strong momma, I love you with all I have.”</p><p>LeAnn was the first wife of baseball player Jim Edmonds, who is featured on the newest season of the Real Housewives of Orange County with his third wife <strong>Meghan King Edmonds</strong>. Meghan’s relationship with Jim and LeAnn’s daughter Hayley — and her challenge to parent Haley amid LeAnn’s failing health — has been chronicled on the current season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jim-Edmonds-Ex-Wife-LeAnn-Edmonds-Horton-Dies-of-Cancer-Daughter-Real-Housewives-of-Orange-County-Cast-React.jpg><p>Meghan, who wed Jim last October, also took to her Twitter to mourn LeAnn. “Today is a sad day.
